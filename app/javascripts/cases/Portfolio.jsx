            <p>March 2016. Redesigning our personal website is a common desire for web designers or
            developers and we all know how long it can actually take before the will becomes action.</p>
            <p>In my case, I felt it was also a necessity because my previous website didn't reflect
            the front-end developer I am currently. Tons of things happened since May 2015, when I ended
            the previous version, and I felt it was counter-productive since visitors could receive
            an outdated concept of me.</p>

            work, but my knowledge is more experienced and I have <strong>something new to show</strong>.</p>
