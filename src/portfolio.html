                <h3>His story</h3>
                <p>Jiayi, known also as Steph, is a strange guy who approached web development in 2013 and got bewitched since then. He loves being updated with <strong>trends and knowledge</strong>, learning from the best international developers and magazines. Despite his young age, he worked hard to push himself so far.
                    <br>Always divided between mind and heart, he is always seeking for challenges capable of conveying strong feelings and making his head spin.
                    <br>In his spare time Jiayi is fond of books of different genres and, although his native language is Italian, he is used to reading English authors in original such as Joyce, Fitzgerald or Wilde. </p>
            </section>
            <section class="work__challenge">
                <h3>The challenge</h3>
                <p>Jiayi is a very precise customer. He pretends everything to be perfect and clear, according to his ideas. He demanded for a website which could show his portfolio and skills as both designer and front-end developer, but that was far from being enough. <strong>Conveying his passion for his work</strong> had to be the crucial aspect. Moreover he wished to be kept in mind by whoever visited the website.</p>

            <section class="work__outcome">
                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>I realized a design based on a modern style, with geometric and rational shapes whereas the colors, backgrounds and images helped to transmit a feeling of magic and joy. <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit/">Google Web Starter Kit</a> suited as framework, according to Google's guidelines whereas several JS libraries such as <a href="http://greensock.com/gsap">GSAP</a> enchanted the visual impact.
                    <br>Words do have a great power and we chose carefully each single word, in order to communicate his love for web design and development. The outcome is the result of our efforts and it cannot leave no marks on anyone who beholds it.</p>

                <h3>His story</h3>
                <p>Lee Ru-ma, better known by his stage name Yiruma, is a pianist and composer from South Korea. Yiruma frequently performs at sold-out concerts in Asia, Europe and North America. His alma mater, King's College London, helped him gain European popularity and recognition. Among his most popular pieces are "River Flows in You", "Kiss the Rain", and "Maybe". Yiruma's most popular album, First Love, was released in 2001.</p>

                <h3>The challenge</h3>
                <p>This is a personal project, which I realized as a tribute towards my favourite pianist and as an opportunity to improve my technical skills. His songs have always the power to calm down my soul or make it wander above the skies of immagination. I wanted to convey this sensation of delicacy and interior struggle, aside from showing his albums and life.</p>

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>My choice fell upon 'black & gold' as colour palette, since the former gives a <strong>wistful atmosphere</strong> whereas gold reminds elegancy and sophistry. <strong>Music was the essential</strong> feature of the website and I wanted the visitor to get in touch with it as soon as possible. To achieve this aim I placed a background video from the very beginning, giving the opportunity to listen to and see Yiruma while he plays his most famous song.
                    <br> As framework I used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>, well-known for responsive development, while <a href="https://developer.spotify.com">Spotify APIs</a> allowed users to listen Yiruma's albums.

                <h3>Her story</h3>
                <p>Sara was born and raised in the beautiful seaside town of Genoa, Italy, where she studied for a degree in Modern Languages and Journalism, specializing in psychology and sociology. After spending a few years in Switzerland, she moved to <strong>London</strong>, a city that she has made her home and which provides <strong>the setting for much of her writing</strong>.
                    <br><em>Ecliptic Saga</em> is her true debut, an urban fantasy-meets-science fiction series for young and adult readers.</p>

            <section class="work__challenge">
                <h3>The challenge</h3>
                <p>Sara needed a redesign of her previous multi-language website, as she was about to publish her second novel and she felt her presence of the web required a boost and improvement. Her previous website was unable to reflect the beauty of her novels and besides it was still based on a obsolete system, which was heavily limiting in functionality. </p>
            </section>
            <section class="work__outcome">
                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p><a href="">WordPress</a> was the answer to her needs, since she asked me also as easy way to publish and manage blog articles. By the customization of an up-to-date premium theme, I realized a website which was focused on her books and the magic inside them. The homepage contains the main features of Ecliptic Saga, providing also an easy access to web stores where readers can buy the novels. Secondary pages reveals more deep aspects about the saga and the author.

                <p><em>World War I</em> is a school project, developed in order to remember the Great War since 2014 is the centenary of the outbreak. As the time flows we shall not forget the tragedies of the war and the lives lost in the fight. </p>

                <h3>The challenge</h3>
                <p>History telling can be very boring when you are not interested in an endless list of chronological events. The challenge was making the visitor live again the years of the Great War, without nevertheless being boring or flat. As always I hoped to convey some emotions, to transmit a sense of loss.</p>

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>Black & White as colours remind both newspapers during those years and the absence of life during the war. There is no place for bright colours when we are talking about one of the darkest moments of mankind. The events of the war are described in the within a day, to make it lighter whereas the sense of drama is hinted by a symphony by Chopin. Last but not least, an interactive geochart shows the number of soldiers died during the war.
